const contract = await hre.ethers.deployContract('ZeekMessages', []);
await contract.waitForDeployment();
```

1. Create script in `/scripts/hh-ethers-deploy.ts`
2. Run with `npx hardhat run scripts/hh-ethers-deploy.ts --network sepolia`

### Migrate

1. run targeting zksync. Success out-of-the-box.
2. Deployed to testnet and verified 0x1E41e03E5cDe9397Ac3c4c9A6080be38bd181dA4
