1. Init project with `npx hardhat init`
2. Setup `.env` file
3. Adds networks and etherscan settings to config


## hardhat-deploy

```ts
const { deployments, getNamedAccounts } = hre; 
const { deploy } = deployments;
const res = await deploy("ZeekMessages", {...})
```

1. Install `hardhat-deploy`, `dotenv` and `hardhat-zksync` and import them in config file
2. Write deploy script with `hardhat-deploy`
3. Deploy to sepolia `npx hardhat deploy --network sepolia`

### Migrate

1. Run same script, target ZKsync: `npx hardhat deploy --network zksyncSepolia`
2. Success! Deployed and verified


## hardhat-ethers

```ts
const contract = await hre.ethers.deployContract('ZeekMessages', []);
await contract.waitForDeployment();
```

1. Create script in `/scripts/hh-ethers-deploy.ts`
2. Run with `npx hardhat run scripts/hh-ethers-deploy.ts --network sepolia`

### Migrate

1. run targeting zksync. Success out-of-the-box.
2. Deployed to testnet and verified 0x1E41e03E5cDe9397Ac3c4c9A6080be38bd181dA4
